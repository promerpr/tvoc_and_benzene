# Location data from AirSense

So, I still don't understand how to download data from AirSense, but I have figured out 2 ways to get location data:

Login to AirSense, and go to Settings/Instruments to get the list of instruments, and then click Latitude/Longitude (or Lat/Lon) for the instrument you want, click  "Graph", then set the parameters you want, then click the hamburger menu on the graph and select "Download csv"

ACtually, a better of way of doing this is to create a custom graph through the "graphs" menu. This is prboably also a good way of getting the raw data out as well.
