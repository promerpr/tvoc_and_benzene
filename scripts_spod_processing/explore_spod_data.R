# Now, what are we trying to do here?
# I think we're trying to understand what co-locations of the SPODs and CAMML we actually have.
# And that's going to require diving into some messy data.

# But it's definitely necessary!
# So, what's the best way to do this?
# Probably to try to figure out the locations of all the SPODs and cross-reference them with the
# CAMML locations.
