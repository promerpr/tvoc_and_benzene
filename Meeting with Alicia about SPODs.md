# Meeting with Alicia about SPODs

## Questions

1. Looking at past deployments of PID measurements with the CAMML. Are all the PID measurements from SPODs? (Does it matter if they aren't?) Any important changes in instruments or data processing I should know about between deployments? 
   1. Taking the data from the CAMML deployment summary spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Ap44MXRSDTABgj9-gp0_z-y9rRImyrvlSSm8MOzDns/edit#gid=0. Is this the right data? 
      1. The data in the sheet might just be the PID in the GC. 
      1. For the SPODs, start with the total VOC monitoring folders in the OGHIR shared drive. 
      1. For the most part, has all been SPOD. Early on, did some experimenting with the ppbRAE. We had a canary out one time at Knight, and the data that we got from it we weren't confident in. The only data Alicia recommends using is the SPODs. 
   1. My starting approach is to average the 1-min PID readings to match the timescale of the GC measurements and then look at correlations. Any reason that wouldn't be the right thing to do? 
   1. Any T/P/RH corrections I should know about? Or if I use the processed data should that all be taken care of?
      1. Humidity is a big factor in the sensitivity. The manufacturers all say that they heat the PID and this isn't an issue, but Alicia thinks that is crazy. Alicia basically throws out all the data if Rh is over 80%. Calibration slope could depend on the conditions (i.e., if the lamp gets dirty), but in general Alicia hasn't seen this. 
1. Looking at the sensitivity of the SPODs to different chemicals - I've found some datasheets for the sensitivity of PID instruments to different chemicals, but nothing SPOD specific. 
   1. Have you looked at the sensitivity of the SPODs to  compounds besides isobutylene? 
      1. Ion Science high-sensitivity is the manufacturer of the PID that Sensit uses. 
   1. Is the energy of the SPOD lamp 10.6 eV? 
   1. Have you used any of the correction factors from other companies, such as Honeywell for their ppbRAE? 
      1. No
1. I'd like to be able to look at the triggered cannister measurements - are those results collected somewhere (ideally with the PID measurements)? 
   1. Alicia should have copies of all the cannister samples data. Tara/Kendra might have the data as well. We haven't taken a whole lot of cannisters recently - some high ones at Brighton, with high levels of benzene.
1. Big picture - when you look at PID measurements, what do you look at? What do you think they tell you? 
   1. We take a look at the overall trend - are we seeing spikes, are we seeing just the normal diurnal variation. If we are seeing activity  (spikes) that are 2-3 times over the baseline. We generally pull the instruments when the concentrations are around baseline for 4+ weeks. 
   1. Alicia really starts paying attention when there are spikes 4-5 times over baseline - get a cannister set up. 

Kristy mentioned that I was interested in the NATTS data up through 2021.
